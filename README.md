## Features
- Uses [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) as the base configuration.
- Custom plugins and keybindings tailored to my workflow.
- Configured with [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) for note-taking.
- Supports [Deno](https://deno.land/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) development.
